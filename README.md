# Quiz App

Quiz App is a project part of the [Treehouse iOS Development Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ios-development). In this project, I was given a simple true/false quiz app. The app functioned correctly, though much of the code needed major refactoring. For instance, the app was based on collection types, which needed to be converted into custom classes or structs. Similarly, the app did not adhere to the Model-View-Controller design pattern as well as it could.

I improved this app by fixing all errors and bugs, doing some UI enhancements, creating some custom structs and classes, refactoring according to MVC, accommodating 4 answer choices, and creating random non-repeating questions.
